<p>It has been a while, so I thought I might update this site.<br />
The CV has been removed. I don't need it anymore, maybe later.</p>

<p>I worked last year in an american fast-food in Paris. Don't do that.</p>

<p>Even thought I now work more, I have more free time. You see slavery still exist. Words are not the same that's all. You have to carefully examine the amount of work you might have to produce at your next job</p>
