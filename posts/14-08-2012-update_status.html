<p>Greetings,</p>

<p>It has been a while, so I thought I might update this site.<br />
Some change were added on the CV (the pdf is still more complete)<br />
Feel free to propose me a job.</p>

<p>While browsing for some games I happened to find a really interesting project. The name is OUYA. You can find more at "website". Basically it is a fair salon console.</p>

<p>Why do I say fair? Take the alternatives:
<ul><li>The paystation 3 alone cost 300 euros.</li>
    <li>You cannot develop on it without paying.</li>
    <li>Add three games at 70 and a controler and you double the price.</li></ul>
For what? A game that can run on a full-HD monitor? Full-HD is old, it is not a feature. XBOX360 is no better.<br />
And I am beginning to think that the games on those platform aren't really ones. That's another debat.</p>

<p>I will take the OUYA. It is cool, you can develop or buy games if you want. The DLC if I understood will not not hinder the gameplay as you will have a complete game and not some semi part you have to complete by buying the remaining.<br />
That is what is featured at least.</p>

<p>Salute.</p>
